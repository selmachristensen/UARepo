    "# Working with Web Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, you have access to spatial and numerical data from multiple data sources; many great spatial data sources will include another type of access that isn't often very popular among the spatial data scientist communities, as we tend to use downloaded data to make any analysis. We consider that only through downloaded data will we be able to work more efficiently. Somehow, those caveats are true. However, we also need to consider the rapid improvement in computational capabilities, the use of the Web and Cloud GIS services, and take advantage of the faster internet connections we can access nowadays. As you probably already know, spatial data come in multiple formats, whether the type of data we need to store or the natural phenomena we try to represent; numerous types of spatial web services serve various purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get to that point, if we work with a window-interface tool like QGIS or ArcGIS, the connection to the spatial data is usually established on local directories; depending on the type of project, you might need to work using a direct connection to a particular spatial database. However, in this example, I will show you how to use web services, in particular spatial web services, to get some numerical and spatial data, load that into your computer memory, process the information and then get the outcomes you can later include as an outcome of any spatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, you can think of a web service as a piece of software designed to allow the interaction and communication between different applications over the internet. That is the keystone! You know that the transmission of your data goes through the internet, which means that a web service enables the exchange of data and, in many cases, also functionality between multiple systems, allowing them to work together seamlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Web services use standard web protocols, such as HTTP, and often communicate using formats like XML or JSON. They enable interoperability, scalability, and integration in distributed computing environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web Services in Urban Analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "In urban analytics, web services facilitate the seamless exchange and analysis of geospatial data, which is vital for understanding and managing urban environments. Spatial Web services provide a platform for sharing geographic information, conducting spatial studies, and delivering real-time data to support urban planning, transportation management, environmental monitoring, and more decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Spatial Web Services:\n",
    "\n",
    "Having spatial web services standards is extremely important., the standards are the glue to geospatial information interoperability, and are used by thousands of organizations across the globe and represented in millions of lines of code. They are backed by international organizations, used in proposals, and implemented to speed up the process of innovation. If you want to explore all the geospatial standands, take a look at the OGC web https://www.ogc.org/standards/ IN the following section I will describe the most common spatial web services you migth find when you work with spatial data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Map Services (WMS):\n",
    "\n",
    "A WMS services is a standard protocol for serving georeferenced **map images** over the web. It allows clients to request maps from a server, which then generates and returns the map images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Feature Services (WFS):\n",
    "\n",
    "A WFS service is a standard for serving and exchanging **vector** data over the web. It enables clients to request and retrieve features (geospatial entities) from a server, supporting more complex data interactions compared to WMS, including the editing and symbology capabilites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoJSON/JSON Web Services:\n",
    "\n",
    "These web services use the JSON format to transmit geospatial data. They are often employed for simple and lightweight data exchange, suitable for web applications and APIs. These web services are popular for transmitting spatial data between clients and servers due to their simplicity and human-readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer):\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs follow the principles of REST architecture, providing a set of rules for building web services. They use standard **HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)** for data manipulation and are often implemented in the form of web APIs. APIs are versatile and widely adopted in numerous geospatial applications and are widely implemented allowing developers to access, manipulate, and retrieve geographic data programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Programming Interface (APIs) represent a 'gate' or otherwise a platform that enables a client (that is you) to interact with a server (for example [Glasgow Open Data](https://developer.glasgow.gov.uk/),  [opendata.bristol.gov.uk](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "According to @amazonWhatAPI:\n",
    "> In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client's software (this might be R pr Python for example) sends a request to the server requesting specific data. The response is the data the client asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "More commonly, the client might be a mobile phone app (e.g. train network status app) and the server is the network operator's server.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs can be private or public types. For more inthe description from @amazonWhatAPI [here](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/#:~:text=API%20stands%20for%20Application%20Programming,other%20using%20requests%20and%20responses.)"
